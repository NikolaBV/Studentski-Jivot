# Studentski Jivot
Full stack web application built with the MERN stack to help collage students surive

# About his project

I started working on a C++ application with a similar idea to practice my C++ skills but midway through that realized
that I can turn this idea into a whole seperate more accessible project due to the fact that I realized
how useful it would be for me and other university students. This project will consist of different tools which we will develop
over time, made specifically for university students to help them manage their student life.

# The team!
I will work on this project with two of my friends:
* [Dimitar Kuzmanov](https://github.com/Sylo369)
* [Atanas Nanov](https://github.com/AtanasNanov)

### These tools will include:

* A spendings calculator to help you with dealing with finances
* A Q&A section which will allow you to communicate with other students
* A page focused on tips and tricks for saving money, time and more
* University and city specific info to help you with your day to day tasks
* A dedicated page to first year students
* And more!
