# Studentski Jivot
Full stack web application built with the MERN stack to help collage students surive

# About his project

I started working on a C++ application with a similar idea to practice my C++ skills but midway through that realized
that I can turn this idea into a whole seperate more accessible project due to the fact that I realized
how useful it would be for me and other university students. This project will consist of different tools which I will develop
over time, made specifically for university students to help them manage their student life.

### These tools will include:

* A spendings calculator to help you with dealing with finances
* A Q&A section which will allow you to communicate with other students
* A page focused on tips and tricks for saving money, time and more
* University and city specific info to help you with your day to day tasks
* A dedicated page to first year students
* And more!
